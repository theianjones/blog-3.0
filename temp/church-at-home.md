## Gospel of the Kingdom

<a id="org38ea1b2"></a>

### podcast notes

The story on [[Palm Sunday]] is laced with [[Tragedy]]

[[Jesus]] would die unjustly.

Jesus saw things differently. Entering into human pain and suffering. Jesus doesnt un do or erase the suffering. Jesus suffering shows us that tragedy cant seperate us from the Lord.

Where is God in Covid-19?

Jesus will die along side us and for us

#### Luke 19:28-48

[link](https://google.com/search?q=Luke%2019:28-48)

The people expected Jesus to bring peace and rule as king in a way that they could understand. Jesus grieved over this because he knew they would suffer and he longed for them to see him as the true King through his suffering. Like Jesus, it’s okay to grieve over shattered expectations and suffering.

Question 1:
Take a moment and express any grief you’re feeling over suffering or shattered expectations.

Question 2:
Jesus is the King despite the way the world looks right now. What questions does that bring up for you? What truths can you rely on at this time?

<a id="org6420933"></a>

#### Isaiah 52:7-53:12

[link](https://google.com/search?q=Isaiah%2052:7-53:12)

This passage proclaims that God himself is coming to rescue his people. This is good news, but it will happen in a surprising way. God’s appointed one, the Messiah, will enter into the suffering and death of our world. There’s a lot of suffering and pain going on in our world right now, but God enters into our suffering. He experiences it personally and is present with us and all those who suffer.

Question 1:
Write down or speak out loud where you see suffering and pain in the world and your community right now.

Question 2:
Now pray or speak out loud these same instances again, taking in the truth that God is present in those situations and suffers with us.

#### John 12:12-33

[link](https://google.com/search?q=John%2012:12-33)

Jesus&rsquo; suffering was the way God’s power and love was shown to the world. The cross shows us that God’s ultimate response to human death and suffering was love, to die alongside us and for us, and to overcome death with his resurrection life. This is Jesus’ upside-down Kingdom.

Question 1:
What is Jesus doing for others in this passage?

Question 2:
Jesus calls his followers to do what he does. In what ways specifically can you suffer alongside others or serve and love others?

### Read and discuss

-   [Read Philemon 1:1-25](<https://bibleproject.com/church-at-home/week20-philemon/#ref-philemon_1:1-25>)
-   How does the meaning of the word koinonia help you better understand Paul’s letter to Philemon?
-   In the letter to Philmeon, Paul inserts himself into the middle of the conflict between Philemon and Onesimus. Paul modeled the good news, believing that it held the power to unite against incredible odds.
-   How is Pauls example like Jesus?
-   Name one relationship that feels difficult to unite. What is one way you can humbly step in the conflict to promote love, equality, and healing mercy?
-   [Colossians 3:1-14](https://bibleproject.com/church-at-home/week20-philemon/#ref-colossians_3:1-14)
-   In this passage, Paul is describing the characteristics of a life that’s fitting to all followers of Jesus and a life that is not. Jesus followers are called to throw out the greedy, lustful, angry markings of the old life and instead adopt the loving, patient, and humble traits of Jesus’ new resurrected life. The old way of life separates people from God and from one another. The new way of life in Jesus unites people to God and to one another.
-   Consider how you have recently interacted with the political, racial, and socio-economic dynamics of your culture. In your interactions, what old instincts are especially difficult for you and/or others to overcome (see verses 5-9)? What relationships might have been avoided or damaged? What is one step you can take towards repair?
-   Read verses 10-11 again. In the new creation family of Jesus, all identities are made equal and unified into one redeemed identity. What might the list in verse 11 sound like if Paul rewrote it for your culture and time?
-   Consider the qualities of your new identity in Jesus: compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness, patience, forgiveness, and love (verses 12-14). Reflect on how Jesus inserted himself into humanity’s conflict while perfectly expressing these qualities. Pray for God’s help to do the same while living from these qualities this week. Pray the same for your family, church, and city.
