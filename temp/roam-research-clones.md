I am collecting clones of Roam Research.

- Azlen Elza created this prototype [on twitter](https://twitter.com/azlenelza/status/1256696567379062784)
- [Athens](https://github.com/athensresearch/athens) is an [[Open Source]] version
- [[Org Roam]] is another [[Open Source]] version
- [[Tiddly Wiki]]
  - [[Ann-Laure Le Cunff]] made this [example: Mental Nodes](https://www.mentalnodes.com/about).
  - [Tiddly Research](https://kebifurai.github.io/TiddlyResearch/)
- [Logseq](https://logseq.com/) is an open source, local first clone of Roam Research. It can be backed by a private github account so no one is storing your data.
- [Foam VS Code](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/) backlinks and graph visualization right in your VScode editor!
