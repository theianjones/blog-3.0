Pomodoro technique is a way to structure your day into 25 minute work blocks. You put a timer on, there are a couple free ones that will keep track of the time for you. After every 25 minute block, you get a 5 minute break. After 4 blocks, you get a 25 minute break.

I use [[org-pomodoro]] to clock into tasks. Org mode will keep a log (through [[org-clock]]) of how long I spend on specific tasks.
