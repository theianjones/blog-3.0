The hands-on prep time for this juicy, tasty, Paleo version of a classic Indian dish is minimal. In fact, everything can be thrown together in about 10 minutes before you head off to work, and the chicken’ll be ready to bake when you get home. You won't believe how easy this is to prepare -- especially after you've tasted the results.

## Ingredients:

- 4 pounds chicken thighs (skin-on or off)
- Kosher salt
- Freshly-ground black pepper
- 1 cup coconut cream or coconut milk
- 1½ tablespoons tandoori seasoning
- 4 limes, divided (juice from 1 lime, and 3 limes quartered)
- 1 tablespoon coconut oil or fat of choice

## Cooking Equipment:

- Large and small bowls
- Citrus juicer
- Wire rack
- Measuring cups and spoons
- Rimmed baking sheet
- Aluminum foil
- Tongs

## Preparation Steps:

0. Liberally season the chicken with salt and pepper in a large bowl. (But if you’re using a pre-brined or Kosher chicken, go light with the salt -- that bird’s already salty.) [4 lb chicken thighs (skin-on or off) salt pepper]
1. Combine the coconut cream and tandoori seasoning in a small bowl. [1 cup coconut cream 1½ T tandoori seasoning]
2. Squeeze the lime juice into the marinade. [Juice from 1 lime]
3. Stir the ingredients together until well-blended.
4. Pour the mixture into the bowl of thighs. Then..
5. Rub the marinade into the chicken.
6. Allow the chicken to marinate for about 8 hours in the fridge.
7. When you’re ready to cook, preheat the oven to 375°F on convection bake or 400°F on regular bake.
8. Place a wire rack on a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet, and then...
9. Grease the rack with a paper towel dipped in melted coconut oil. [1 T coconut oil or fat of choice]
10. Arrange the chicken on the rack (skin-side down if you're using skin-on chicken) and pop the tray in the oven for about 40 minutes, flipping the pieces over at the halfway mark.
11. The chicken’s done when there’s yummy charred bits all over, and the juices run clear when you stab the meat.
12. Serve with lime wedges and your favorite sides. [3 limes, quartered]
