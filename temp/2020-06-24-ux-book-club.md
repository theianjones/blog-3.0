## Three Main Takeaways

1.  Creating shared understanding is one of the most important aspects of collaborative learning
2.  Collaboration does not, in itself, produce learning. Collaborative environments need to be designed to produce effective conversation. This reminds me of [[Evan Czaplicki]]'s talk [The History of Open Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_4EX4dPppA) where he talks about how conversation needs to be designed to be productive (and how elm has managed bad actors).
3.  Creating Shared understanding of the task to be accomplished is the cornerstone to effective collaboration.

## Practical Application

As we think about designing workshops, its important to design the interactions learners have with one another. We want fruitful conversation which principles in [[Computer Supported Collaborative Learning]] can help us.

## What I learned in a tweet

When you are learning with your peers, simply collaborating will not improve your outcome. You need to establish a shared understanding of the subject and set expectations for communication.
