Abolish Big Data

[[Big Data]] is not new, it has a long history.

Reject the structures that put the power of big data into the hands of the view.

School to prison pipeline

There are narratives that power these structures.

The narrative of risk.

The Coming of the Super Predators - article written by someone on George W. Bushes staff that ciminalized whole generations of kids.

Big data practices come out of the Dutch East and West companies. They had offices all over the world to trafic 12.5 million africans all over the world.

Information systems were needed to keep track of Africans, cattle, and weapons.

Algorithms are opinions embeded in code.

Algorithms: What are we optimizing?

[[FICO]] - a for profit algorithm company. We aren&rsquo;t able to verify our FICO score. Its a black box. It shows us how algorithms dominate our lives.

Fuck FICO.

You can&rsquo;t sue an algorithm.

FICO says they dont use race as a variable. Zip codes are a proxy for race though.

Zipcodes become neglected and left behind. They become 4th world.

There are many proxies for race. What are they?

Risk ratios are used by the policy and city officials to oppress kids.
