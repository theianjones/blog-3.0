Money - nobody has enough, everyone wants more

Money will never satisfy your needs

Matthew 6:19-21

> Lay Up Treasures in Heaven
> 19 “Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust[a] destroy and where thieves break in and steal, 20 but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal. 21 For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.

Are treasures bad?

Parable of the shrewd manager.

> The Parable of the Shrewd Manager
> 16 Jesus told his disciples: “There was a rich man whose manager was accused of wasting his possessions. 2 So he called him in and asked him, ‘What is this I hear about you? Give an account of your management, because you cannot be manager any longer.’
>
> 3 “The manager said to himself, ‘What shall I do now? My master is taking away my job. I’m not strong enough to dig, and I’m ashamed to beg— 4 I know what I’ll do so that, when I lose my job here, people will welcome me into their houses.’
>
> 5 “So he called in each one of his master’s debtors. He asked the first, ‘How much do you owe my master?’
>
> 6 “‘Nine hundred gallons[a] of olive oil,’ he replied.
>
> “The manager told him, ‘Take your bill, sit down quickly, and make it four hundred and fifty.’
>
> 7 “Then he asked the second, ‘And how much do you owe?’
>
> “‘A thousand bushels[b] of wheat,’ he replied.
>
> “He told him, ‘Take your bill and make it eight hundred.’
>
> 8 “The master commended the dishonest manager because he had acted shrewdly. For the people of this world are more shrewd in dealing with their own kind than are the people of the light. 9 I tell you, use worldly wealth to gain friends for yourselves, so that when it is gone, you will be welcomed into eternal dwellings.
>
> 10 “Whoever can be trusted with very little can also be trusted with much, and whoever is dishonest with very little will also be dishonest with much. 11 So if you have not been trustworthy in handling worldly wealth, who will trust you with true riches? 12 And if you have not been trustworthy with someone else’s property, who will give you property of your own?
>
> 13 “No one can serve two masters. Either you will hate the one and love the other, or you will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money.”
>
> 14 The Pharisees, who loved money, heard all this and were sneering at Jesus. 15 He said to them, “You are the ones who justify yourselves in the eyes of others, but God knows your hearts. What people value highly is detestable in God’s sight.

God is not against storing up treasures

Make sure to store up treasures that will last.

You cant take it with you but you can send it on ahead.

2 Peter 3:10-11

> 10 But the day of the Lord will come like a thief, and then the heavens will pass away with a roar, and the heavenly bodies[a] will be burned up and dissolved, and the earth and the works that are done on it will be exposed.[b]
>
> 11 Since all these things are thus to be dissolved, what sort of people ought you to be in lives of holiness and godliness,

&ldquo;Full amount of 10%&rdquo;&#x2026; that feels like an assumption

&ldquo;God sent the money somehow&rdquo;

Material possessions are secondary

What are some kingdom causes that we could give time/money to?

What is the God honoring way to find happiness?

Where does your treasure lie?

## My thoughts

The bible passages they reference feel like the most obvious passages to point to and it feels like a belabored point. It seems like everyone knows that the Bible says that we shouldn&rsquo;t value money as much as the church or the kingdom.

In light of this, how are these passages useful to me event though I feel this way?

Mark 12:41-44

> The Widow’s Offering
> 41 Jesus sat down opposite the place where the offerings were put and watched the crowd putting their money into the temple treasury. Many rich people threw in large amounts. 42 But a poor widow came and put in two very small copper coins, worth only a few cents.
>
> 43 Calling his disciples to him, Jesus said, “Truly I tell you, this poor widow has put more into the treasury than all the others. 44 They all gave out of their wealth; but she, out of her poverty, put in everything—all she had to live on.”

Matthew 19:16–30

> The Rich and the Kingdom of God
> 16 Just then a man came up to Jesus and asked, “Teacher, what good thing must I do to get eternal life?”
>
> 17 “Why do you ask me about what is good?” Jesus replied. “There is only One who is good. If you want to enter life, keep the commandments.”
>
> 18 “Which ones?” he inquired.
>
> Jesus replied, “‘You shall not murder, you shall not commit adultery, you shall not steal, you shall not give false testimony, 19 honor your father and mother,’[a] and ‘love your neighbor as yourself.’[b]”
>
> 20 “All these I have kept,” the young man said. “What do I still lack?”
>
> 21 Jesus answered, “If you want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.”
>
> 22 When the young man heard this, he went away sad, because he had great wealth.
>
> 23 Then Jesus said to his disciples, “Truly I tell you, it is hard for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of heaven. 24 Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.”
>
> 25 When the disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished and asked, “Who then can be saved?”
>
> 26 Jesus looked at them and said, “With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.”
>
> 27 Peter answered him, “We have left everything to follow you! What then will there be for us?”
>
> 28 Jesus said to them, “Truly I tell you, at the renewal of all things, when the Son of Man sits on his glorious throne, you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. 29 And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or wife[c] or children or fields for my sake will receive a hundred times as much and will inherit eternal life. 30 But many who are first will be last, and many who are last will be first.

Proverbs 3:27

> 27 Do not withhold good from those to whom it is due,
> when it is in your power to act.

Proverbs 14:21

> 21 It is a sin to despise one’s neighbor,
> but blessed is the one who is kind to the needy.
