I have been writing a lot more over the past couple of months. It is easy for me to write about things that I am interested in learning. These are generally more advanced development topics.

I have been thinking about putting out beginner friendly material. Obtaining the beginner mind set is hard. Once you've lost it, you assume things that might not be apparent.

Theres a balance between giving enough context to learn and holding back so you don't overwhelm.

How do you put yourself in correct mindset to teach someone that is completely new to a topic?
