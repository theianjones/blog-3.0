## 3 take aways

1.  Don Norman teaches 3 levels of design: Visceral, Behavioral, Reflective.
    2 of these levels are unconscious and drive a lot of the feelings we have towards a product. Reflective design draws on peoples identities and who they want/think of themselves.
2.  Behavioral design should reflect the real world. People come to your site with conceptual models of how things should work, understanding these conceptual models with make a more pleasurable experience.
3.  To design at the reflective level, we must understand what a product means to a user.

## Pracitical Application

This lesson reminded me of the 4 buckets that Joel mentioned in one of our meetings and how we can design a site that makes one of these feelings or aspirations apparent:
  
solid foundation - this is folks that are working on the basics to build a solid career foundation.

going deep - this is for folks that want a deeper level understanding of the tools they use. Algorithms, data structures, computer science topics&#x2026;

stay current - this is for folks that are trying to keep their thumb on the pulse. What&rsquo;s new, what&rsquo;s changed, what are they missing&#x2026;

shine at work - this is for folks that have real problems to solve and want to look smart and stay relevant on the job

## What I learned in a tweet

When you are designing a product, a lot of the design will be processed unconsciously. The aspects your audience does process will be heavily tied to their story and what they are trying to do.
