How do we productively frame a design problem?

<a id="org20c6898"></a>

What is the outcome we are trying to reach? How do we frame the outcome?

Alexander wants to make the part of world you are in better. This is the concept of Life.

<a id="orgdb6fa04"></a>

What are the steps we go through to get this outcome?

Pattern Language, the book, wont give you the fundamental ideas here.

## Notes on Synthesis of Form

First two chapters are essential.

- Form: the concrete form that the project takes on. Code, Buildings, Pixels, etc.

  Theres a style based ideology for design. Without understanding why.

  Requirements are generally described in Form.

  If your definition of success is based on form, its infinitely circular. You must understand how the behavior fits into the form.

- Context: the activities that people are trying to accomplish through the form
- Fit: the relationship between the form and the context fit together. This is the judgement of success for the form for a given context.

## Nature of Order

- **Life:** degree to which a certain form enables an activity

### Building Picture

Ryan gives an example of a Soviet building and an Alexander building. The soviet building does not **afford** activity around the base of the building. Alexanders building allow for all sorts of activity.

### Planter example

The previous planter couldnt afford sitting. The sitting isn&rsquo;t the point. Its the context of the sitting that matters. Taking a phone call, eating lunch with someone, having a coffee

### Topic of Centers

- **Center:** are the forms that more related to eachother than other forms that we want to focus on
  The face is an example. Eyes, nose, mouth, are salient structures.
  The bones that connect your eyes to your nose are secondary, your eyes look somewhere, your face follows.

  If salient elements aren&rsquo;t related to eachother, they aren't centers. Or they are weak centers.

  Every structure has strong and weak centers.

  15 properties that Alexander defines. A couple of them:

  - levels of scale
  - boundaries
  - void

### How do we improve form through process? Generative Process

Uses example of a map of Rome.

You use step by step unfolding to get a harmonious whole.

Order of problem solving is important.

Book 2 of nature of order.

Key value of a pattern language is different than software devs thing.

- **A pattern:** is a generic relation of centers

  Example - 6 foot balcony

  If you build a balcony thats less that 6 feet deep, you cant afford most activities. people will sit in circles, stretch your legs.

  Gives you an essential aspect of the relationship of the forms. This gives fit for Life.

  Ryan gives a pattern of sequence. A kitchen

  - find the shape of the kitchen
  - place the windows
  - place the kitchen table
  - place door way to the outside garden
  - then place the counters

This sequence matters because you can only place windows in particular places etc. You dont build a kitchen in one step.

### Pattern languages are generic solved patterns - not the main thing though

<a id="orgb1a4f46"></a>

### Pattern languages are a way to specifcy 1 unique project

Making one project that is beautiful or useful is hard.

We can&rsquo;t draw a master plan. Its a sequence.

&ldquo;Unifying design and structure at the right level of scale&rdquo;.

## Battle

Case study of Eishin campus

<a id="org60af309"></a>

## Software Example

A wall of faces. Its not best to just group people arbitrarily. We need the context to inform the groups.

Some are involved in the project, but others are just informed. Others are included for transparency.

## Summary

1.  Frame the problem in Form and Context so we have an empirical judgement of fit
2.  We want to make a world full of meaning
3.  We do this through centers, relationship between coherent structures
4.  Theres a sequence of problem solving for centers
5.  Specify the world at the right level of abstraction

## Q&A

Shape up is a way to define a pattern language.

Ryan saw a relationship between DHH and Friedman and Alexander

If we can look for struggles and design a solution with a better adaptive design, you&rsquo;ve done some healing.

[Synthetic A Priori](https://overcast.fm/itunes1519528264/synthetic-a-priori)<SideNote>Ryan Singers Podcast</SideNote>

Domain Driven Design - book

- Notes of synthesis of form ch 1 and 2
- Battle as example of pattern language of how a project was built
- then nature of order

[[Jobs to be done]] and Alexander? - defining context in such a way so you can have a fit to form. How do i translate the form to give a fit to context?

Clayton Christensen - Modularity Theory

How do you know you are on the right path and not trial and error?

- which things are most important
- which things have the fewest possibilities for how they will be successful

How do you understand things so deeply? - What are they saying? Can I apply this? Try applying it. Struggle, and come back to the thing

You need to understand the context in order to have fit.

Rewired Group.

Shape up is a generative design process.
