## The Mission

[[Fairfax Bible Church]] Mission:

To glorify God by makeing disciples of all nations as we live in loving community.

<a id="orgab94a79"></a>

## How do we make disciples?

We aspire to the concept of multiplication.

> and what you have heard from me in the presence of many witnesses entrust to faithful men, who will be able to teach others also.
> 2 Timothy 2:2

We use small groups to make teach the word, fellowship with one another, and pray with each other.

<a id="orgbb882cd"></a>

## Live in Loving community

We want to connect with those that are in our Church and small group. We want to be open and vulnerable with eachother. We want to show Christ centered love to one another.

This community should be the place we build lasting relationships.

<a id="orge22a802"></a>

## How to lead a small group?

We realize that small group may not be the best way to teach content, mentor others, and fellowship all at once but it is the tool we have chosen that does a pretty good job of each.

<a id="org2753cc2"></a>

## Leader

A small group leader, is first and formost a leader. We lead with our strengths and realize that God will show up in our weaknesses.

There is no way to manufacture disciples. You cultivate them.

<a id="orge481b8f"></a>

### Strength Finders

We took the strength finders test to see what some areas we could excel leading our small groups in. Mine were:

- Input
- Relator
- Intellection
- Developer
- Consistency

<a id="org5222ba6"></a>

### Master Plan of Evangelism

We read Master Plan of Evangelism by Robert E. Colman to discuss how Jesus cultivated and led his disciples.

Jesus had 12 disciples, a relatively small number of people to reach the WHOLE world. He pour his heart and soul into them. Among these 12 he had 3 espectially close disciples. This gives us a model on how we can make disciples. By teaching those in your circle how to teach others.

Truth in Christ starts with obediance, then understanding follows. Having men that you can look up to as examples of this makes a big difference.

<a id="orgd7ffa6a"></a>

## Teacher

We are humble learners. We develop questions around content to facilitate discussion.

We want to connect before we deliver content. This will help everyone stay engaged and interested.

As a teacher, you do not need to know everything. Things that you dont know can be discussed as a group and an opportunity to do some research of report back to the group.

Teaching in small group plays an important role. Steeping ourselves in the word of God helps us grow and see the world like He does.

<a id="org080a89b"></a>

### Questions for Facilitation

1.  What?

    What questions confirm understanding of the text, termonology, and concepts. The Right Now Media videos do a generally good job of covering these questions.

2.  So, What?

    A lot of leader guides you will come in contact with will be weak in this area.

    So, What questions establish connections with other text. They bring to light a pattern in the Bible or a strong metaphor. This is where we can ground the text we are discussing in a real way.

    &ldquo;Where else in scripture have we seen this principle?&rdquo;

3.  Now What?

    Now what questions drive the application of the text home. How can we apply what we are learning to our lives?

    You can ask general now what questions to the group and get specific in break out time.

    Applying application to how we as a church can do better in the area we are discussing is a good frame.

## Sheparding

Sheparding is the primary vehicle for discipleship and care.

> Know well the condition of your flocks,
> and give attention to your herds,
> Poverbs 27:23

We are responsible for the people we are leading in our small group. This is a serious matter. We aren&rsquo;t without support though.

Jeff gave us 3 points to focus on:

<a id="org0ddc371"></a>

### Know

We need to keep our eyes and ears open and check on every person in our group. People won&rsquo;t often just tell you whats going wring.

We will give a sheparding report once a month. This serves as a reminder to be asking your group how they are doing.

God has entrusted his people into our care.

<a id="org6cc87ba"></a>

### Care

1 Brothers, if anyone is caught in any transgression, you who are spiritual should restore him in a spirit of gentleness. Keep watch on yourself, lest you too be tempted. 2 Bear one another&rsquo;s burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ.
Galatians 6:1-2

Bear one anothers burdens. Small group is a safety net. The &ldquo;first responders&rdquo; of our church body. Its important that people are able to share whats on their heart. How else can the church pray for these people?

We need to deal with the sin that we see. We can&rsquo;t ignore it.

<a id="orgbf4134b"></a>

### Disciple

> praying at all times in the Spirit, with all prayer and supplication. To that end, keep alert with all perseverance, making supplication for all the saints,
> Ephesians 6:18

As small group leaders, we need to help our group grow spiritually. How do we do this?

Worship, Walk, Work

Church is not a menu. We can&rsquo;t just pick and choose any of these areas and expect to grow.

Whats this look like?

Worship - Come to Church
Walk - Join a small group
Work - serve in a ministry

<a id="orgb715247"></a>

## SoS tool

This stands for Severity, Ownership, and Support.

![Severity Ownership Support](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fians-big-roam%2FOZZAuTBLC1?alt=media&token=e78e94fb-e0e7-4bdd-995c-fe322c2837ec)

We need to gather data. On the legal side, Virginia is a mandatory reporting state. If we think abuse is happening we need to report to our elders.

Confidentiality is important but some things are more important.

## Fruit to Root

![Fruit to Root](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fians-big-roam%2FksbujUFRvC?alt=media&token=f86927f4-b358-4413-8489-59645679d8cf)

Out of the abondance of your heart, the mouth speaks.

Behaviors are the fruit of the heart. We aren&rsquo;t interested in changing behaviours. We want to change the people in our small groups heart.

Small group isnt making better versions of you.

We want to focus on questions that get to the desires and motives of people.

What were you thinking or feeling?

What are they really wanting?

What should you be wanting instead?
