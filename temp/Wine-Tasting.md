### Review 
- Look: deep red, fairly high viscosity 
- Smell: delicate plum smell. hints of marshmellow, dusty, smells like grapes
- Taste: =Smooth= /tannic Light/ =bold= dry / =sweet= soft / =acidic=
	juicy, tannins build to a light level, a little peppercorn
	
	It's fine, but nothing special about it to be worth $20 to buy again
