## Summary

### What I learned in a tweet

You aren&rsquo;t selling a product. You are selling the experience your product provides. How does that experience transform the people that use your product? [twitter link](https://twitter.com/_jonesian/status/1265666729948127233)

### Three take-aways

0.  People are buying an experience first and for most. They dont care about the technical decisions that are made
1.  Design is a conversation between the designer and the people that use the design. This conversation happens in time, so its important to consider the story your telling
2.  Products are an opportunity to change the behavior of the people buying. Design should facilitate this change with the motives of the people in mind.

### Practical Application

[[Experience Design]] can be applied to how our members learn. Do they want to change their habits when it comes to how they learn? Can we provide an experience that changes their behavior in a way that makes it clear that there is a more effective we to learn? [[Learn in Public]] [[Really Good Notes]]

## 3.2 [[Marc Hassenzahl]] introduction to UX

Marc dislikes user experience as a term. Experience is a broader field.

UX is a field of study.

2 ways to look at experience:

- in the moment experience. What you do/in the moment. Focuses on the how.

  moment by moment is very small. the memory of the experience lasts a lot longer.

- marc likes to design for stories or the experiences.

How can we tell a story in a product. He uses the wake up light as an example.

&ldquo;Experiencial solution&rdquo;

iPhone is an infrastructure. The experiences are in the applications. Marc likes to forget the whole product and provide an experience.

Talks about different shades of materialism. People are starting to want the experience. &ldquo;post-materialistic.&rdquo;

This makes me thinks about how it doesnt matter what stack you choose for an application, is the experience you are providing the right one? does your software provide the experience that you need?

## 3.3 Marc Hassenzahl Guidelines for Experience Design

Design is a dialogue.

- The user has their values and what they want
- the designer has their values and what they want
- the design is the medium this conversation happens

Experience Design

- why? - be goals
- what? - do goals?
- how? - motor goals

The why gets ignored a lot of the time.

Design the why before the what and how.

What emotions do you want the user to have&#x2026; then implement the product that fills those emotions.

Design is time dependent. Its not static. Experience Design, you are writing scripts or stories.

Example

grape picking product. A grape picking bucket that you can turn over into a seat. The story comes from grape pickers needing breaks after they finish a bucket load.

Theres a responsibility of the designer to tell the correct story.

## 3.4 Marc Hassenzahl Future Directions for Experience Design

Think of the experience before the product.

Samsung doesn't manufactur tvs, they provide a tv viewing experience.

The methods reflect your background. We need to pull methods from multiple backgrounds.

You need to figure out the effects of your product before you release it.

Automation is outcome oriented. Automation can separate you from the actual task you are doing.

Tea making example.

Shape behavior of people in a way that gives them an insight into why you want them to do that thing.

Transformational design

I want to behave differently but I need something to help me change.

Use the motives of the user to help drive your product. How can you align the motives of a user with what your product provides?
