These are notes that you take while you are working. If the note feels like it has legs, it can be extracted into Todo/notes to be completed later.

These notes are throw away at the end of the day. I don't want to go back and update these files although they will still exist on my computer for reference. They are still useful because of [[Org Roam]] backlinks.
