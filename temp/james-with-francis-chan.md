My [[Small Group]] has been going over [Francis Chan's Right Now media course on James](https://www.rightnowmedia.org/Content/Series/159923).

## James 5:7-12

ESV:

### Patience in Suffering

**7** `Be patient`, therefore, brothers, until the coming of the Lord. See how the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the earth, being patient about it, until it receives the early and the late rains.
**8** You also, be patient. Establish your hearts, `for the coming of the Lord is at hand.`
**9** **Do not grumble against one another**, brothers, so that you may not be judged; behold, the Judge is standing at the door.
**10** As an **example of suffering and patience, brothers, take the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord**.
**11 **Behold, we consider those blessed who remained steadfast. You have heard of the steadfastness of Job, and you have seen the purpose of the Lord, how the Lord is compassionate and merciful.
**12** **But above all, my brothers**, `do not swear`, either by heaven or by earth or by any other oath, but let your “yes” be yes and your “no” be no, so that you may not fall under condemnation.

### Small Group Discussion Questions

[Small Group Guide](https://reader.rightnowmedia.org/5/160682)

### Discussion Timeline

- "Whats something that you hate waiting for?"
- "Who is the most patient person you know?"
- "**According to verse 7, what did people need to be patient about?**"
- "My mom is big into gardening so I would have to spend many afternoons digging up weeds, moving dirt around the yard, and planting flowers and bushes for her. Has anyone worked in a garden before? What sort of patience does it require? How is working in a garden like waiting for Jesus return?"
  - "Why is the coming of the lord worth waiting for?"
- But these believers weren’t just waiting, they were suffering. We know from history that there was growing opposition to the Jesus movement from Rome and from those Jews who did not follow Jesus.
  - "James says in verse 11 that those who persevere through suffering are “blessed.” **What does he mean by that?**"
  - **Flip back to James 1:2–4. Would someone read that for us?**
  - How does that fill out your idea of the blessedness of suffering?

> What God wants to do is not just to make you happy—he wants to make you holy. He wants you to be a reflection of him. And it’s the trials, the sufferings, that make us more like Christ. He says he wants us mature, complete, not lacking in anything. Have you ever thought about that as the goal of your life? - Francis Chan

- **Is it true? Is suffering part of what it means to be human?**
  - Suffering is such a common, but certainly not trivial, part of life that it’s everywhere you look. There are all types of suffering in the world. The large-scale suffering of war and hunger and poverty and persecution, but also the personal suffering of the death of a loved one, having your heart broken, or having a life-altering disease.
- **What other types of suffering have you seen or even experienced?**
  - The Bible is full of encouragement for those who suffer, whether that suffering is coming in the form of persecution or from some other force. We can even bring suffering upon ourselves. But Scripture keeps reminding us that God still cares, He has not abandoned us, that He sits with us in our suffering, and that we will come out of this stronger than before.
- **What encouragement does James give us here?**
  - He provides two examples. First the “prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord.” Jeremiah is the best example of a prophet who suffered for speaking the truth. (Also, if you’re counting up allusions to the Sermon on the Mount, here’s another. Check out Matthew 5:11–12.) The second example is Job.
- James doesn’t get into the unfairness of it. He doesn’t get into why suffering is allowed. What he seems to do is acknowledge that it’s going to happen and says, “Here’s what we can do with the suffering.”
- What are things that we can do for those that are suffering today?
- Theres a temptation to grumble and complain in this season of quarantine, what can we do instead?
