### Lesson 2 Summary

1.  What I learned in a tweet

    User experience research makes your application more pleasurable; it also reduces the cost of your project over time. You spend less time tweaking your product after launch. UX research also reduces the chance to miss your target audience completely ðŸ˜³

2.  Three take-aways

    1.  UX research increases the chance that you actually solved a problem
    2.  You, as the designer, are the expert of the app you build
    3.  The sooner you start doing research the sooner your product will align with the needs of your users

3.  Practical Applications

    Kent is releasing epicreact.dev soon and we are talking about a new lesson model where a lesson has multiple parts. Getting this in front of users as soon as we can before the launch will make everything go much smoother.

### 2.2 How to Sell UX Design to Client

Benefits of UX

1.  Products that meet the user&rsquo;s needs - If your users are involved in the design process then your final product should meet their needs. That should deliver a more commercially viable offering and thus higher levels of profit for the company.

2.  **Products that require less tinkering after release** - It&rsquo;s cheaper and easier to tweak sketches, wireframes and prototypes than it is to tweak a product after launch. UX enables a company to work out what doesn&rsquo;t work and then abandon it before the development phase rather than after.

3.  Products which are less risky to the business&rsquo;s reputation - UX is a quality measure. When you release products that users love to use and that meet their needs; your business reputation will grow. Conversely if you don&rsquo;t get things right - your reputation will fall.

4.  Products which are relatively immune to scope creep - If you **define the user&rsquo;s needs and then design with them in mind; there should be a whole lot less scope creep** and that makes it easier to budget for a project and to define a delivery timetable.

5.  Products which are competitive - the research phase of UX means that you should know what competitors are doing and how your product will be &ldquo;better&rdquo;. Design in this manner is based on the evidence and not on the &ldquo;gut instincts&rdquo; of the development team.

**User experience should lower the cost of development and increase customer satisfaction.**

[[Frank Spillers]] CEO at Experience Dynamics gives a talk about ROI of UX. It&rsquo;s very long.. I dont want to watch this.

### 2.3 What it is and why you should do it

3 reasons to do user testing

1.  create designs that are truly relavent
2.  create designs that are easy and pleasurable to use
3.  understand ROI of UX design

UX places humans at the center of your design. There are quantitative methods and qualatative methods to do [[User Research]].

Quantative: Surveys and formal experiments
Qualitative: Interviews and usability tests

1.  create designs that are truly relavent

    If you cant understand your users, theres no way to make your design relevant to them.

    They mention [[Design Thinking]] here

    Interviews and observing users in the context where they will use your design should be an inital step in a project.

    Build the habit of testing your designs on users.

    They cite an example where samsung did user research on tvs and found that people were using tvs more as furniture and not center pieces, keeping the tv turned off and hidden most of the time. This allowed them to adjust their designs to more minimalistic tvs.

2.  create designs that are easy and pleasurable to use

    > The day where tools that can only be used by experts are long gone.

    This reminds me of emacs. Only programmers can use it because its so configurable and honestly has poor ux.

    You are the expert of how to use your own product. This blinds us from the [[Beginners Mindset]]

3.  understand ROI of UX design

    The idea here is that UX is often the first thing to get cut from the budget. This wont be an issue at egghead.

    > If you can show that the changes you made in the design generated more sales, resulted in a larger number of customers, or made work processes more efficient, you have a much stronger case for investing in UX.
