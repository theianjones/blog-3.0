## Meeting notes

1.  [[Joel Hooks]]

    Design isn't a check list. Its ever evolved.

    Likes the potential points/essay questions.

    Liked the overall progress and milestones - whats going to happen

    Disappointed when you don't reach perfection - theres no such thing

    Seeing testing js content on [[egghead]] is an empathy problem.

    Jobs to be done - what job is egghead solving? what job is a course solving right now?

    Month subscriptions solve a problem right now. A year subscription is generally useful.

    Add topics list in the lesson description.

    Learn UX Design is also a course

    Focusing on [[Interaction Design]] for past couple of years

    SuperHi is a ui course. Uses figma.
