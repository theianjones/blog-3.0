## Lesson 1

<a id="org3dc8875"></a>

### What I learned in a tweet

User experience is a broad category that touches many different sciences. Understanding the Humans that use your product is essential to building a product that connects with them.

<a id="orgbcf27d4"></a>

### Top 3 takeaways

1.  Researching your real life users is crucial to a successful design
2.  Personifying the different kind of users prevents putting them in a box
3.  Real life context affects how your users interact with your software

<a id="org1d46945"></a>

### 1.3 Why is UX Design so Important

The change of the name signifies a shift in the field.

Experience is why users go to specific systems.

ISO 9421
effectiveness - does it doe the right thing?
efficiency - does it do that with minimum effort?
satisfaction - does it make you feel good?

Emotion is the bottom line. Make your customers happy.

1.  1.3 quiz

### 1.4 Mind the Empathy Gap

[[Willian Hudson]] gives this video lesson.

> Mind the gap.
>
> - Undergound Tube

There is a gap between what developers think are good for users and what is actually good for users.

Serveral kinds of empathy

We are talking about cognative empathy.

Understand a problem from an other persons point of view. [[Mindwise (Book)]] says that the only effective way to do this is to ask someone what their point of view is.

Empathizers have <span class="underline">Theory of mind</span>

sytemizers - build and understand systems - causality

[picture of eq and sq chart](https://share.getcloudapp.com/7Ku0qKj9)

Men are more inclined to have a drop in eq as you have a more technological job

increasing empathy on teams can improve [[User Experience]]

Focus on methods to improve the teams understanding of users

- field research
- personas
- persona stories as a replacement for user stories
- empathy promoting usability testing
- focus of development on user behaviour and needs

### 1.5 Usability A part of the User Experience

Usability - the ease of access and/or use of a product or website.

There are levels of usability.

Usability can be measured. It should be measured through out all the steps.

### 1.6 Human Centered Design

Using the word &ldquo;user&rdquo; dehumanizes them

- Research
- understand
- interact with your users

- Observations
- research
- evaluation
- on its own, poor solution to the over all problem

Research and undersand the contexts of use.

> The contexts of use are everything about how systems are actually employed in the real world.

Example:

Cafe/pub vs SuperMarket

Super market, theres an operator of the check out software and one person buying the things with 100 or more items. needs to be done efficiently

Cafe, there are many operators. Need to switch customers quickly.

We often design for environments that are similare to our own.

[Diagram for user centered design proces](https://google.com/search?q=https://share.getcloudapp.com/WnuGmO9x)s

Research contexts of use -> specify user requirements -> produce design solutions -> evaluate against requirements -> back to some previous step || meets requirements

Just evaluating will only filter out bad designs -> you end up with a lot of waste. It can&rsquo;t be the only one

Produce prototypes as early as possible
