Programming languages are an extension of how we think as humans. So the constraints that you program in will effect how you think about problems. This could be abstracted out into how communities around programming languages form and develop their shape. This could be the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis<SideNote idName={1}>A hypothesis, first advanced by Edward Sapir in 1929 and subsequently developed by Benjamin Whorf, that the structure of a language determines a native speaker's perception and categorization of experience.</SideNote> at work.

I dont have first hand experience with Haskell but from what I am told, the community is austere and a little unwelcoming. On the other hand, I have just discovered [ClojureFam](https://github.com/athensresearch/ClojureFam) that has been formed around [Athens Research](https://github.com/athensresearch/athens). [Jeff Tang](https://twitter.com/tangjeff0) wanted to learn [[Clojure]] so he decided to build a clone of [[Roam Research]].
