title: Customize Variables in Doom Emacs
tags: [emacs, org mode]

You can run `SPC h v` in [[Doom Emacs]] to customize a packages variables. Doom gives us a nice graphical interface to customize our variables.

An example: Org mode lets you cutomize how you open links with the `org-link-frame-setup` variable.

There are three options:

- `find-file`

This option opens the file in the current window.

- `find-file-other-window`

This option opens the file in another window.

- `find-file-other-frame`

This opens the file in another frame.
